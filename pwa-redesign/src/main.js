 *
 * Registering is the easy half. The half that actually matters is noticing
 * when a NEW service worker has taken over and reloading so the running page
 * is not the old build talking to new firmware.
 *
 * Without this, flashing the robot required clearing browsing data before the
 * updated interface appeared. The service worker was serving a cached /m.js
 * forever; see public/sw.js for the cache-first bug that caused it.
