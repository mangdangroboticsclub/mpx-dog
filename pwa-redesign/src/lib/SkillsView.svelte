   * SkillsView — the robot's skills, as skills.
   *
   * Anything pushed with `mpx-cli deploy` used to surface only as a row in the
   * raw LittleFS file browser: an emoji, a filename, a byte count. You could
   * not tell a skill from a config blob, "Run" popped a browser alert that said
   * "started" whether the module worked or trapped on its first instruction,
   * and marketplace skills lived on a completely separate screen buried in
   * Settings.
   *
   * This screen is the skill list, with the file browser demoted to a segment
   * you can switch to when you actually want to poke at the filesystem.
   *
   * Three sources are merged into one list:
   *   - GET /v1/skills/list   — .wasm / .mpxe at the LittleFS root (the CLI)
   *   - GET /v1/lua/list      — .lua scripts under /lua
   *   - GET /v1/marketplace/robot/skills — skills bought from the marketplace
   *
   * The marketplace call needs the robot's uplink, so it is allowed to fail
   * quietly: no uplink simply means that section is not rendered. A skill you
   * uploaded yourself must never be hidden because the internet is down.
